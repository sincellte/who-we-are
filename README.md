# Who are we ?
We are a French working group focused on **single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics**, invloving 6 institutes/platforms. Our aim to exchange best practices, experience and know-how in the processing and analysis of datasets.

We have organised [two summer/winter schools](https://github.com/sincellte/schools) to train bioinformaticians and biostatisticians to the analysis of single-cell omics datasets.
